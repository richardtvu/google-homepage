This repository contains the HTML/CSS project for The Odin Project's [Web Development 101 Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css?ref=lnav).

I am starting this project on 12/7/2019 and anticipate that the following skills, copy and pasted from the Odin Project:

``` 
Two ways to move a div around on the page
Stick a div onto the bottom or top of the page
Identify the background color of an existing webpage
Grab the URL for an image from an existing webpage
Center an element horizontally
Identify three ways you can include your CSS styles in a page
Understand how to use classes and ids to target CSS at specific elements on the page
Build a very basic form (even if it doesn’t “go” anywhere)
```

## Goals:

* [x] Upon completion of the project, I intend to review what I've done in this project and what I've learned.

  + [x] What have I done in this project?
  + [x] What have I learned?

* [x] Build a webpage that _looks_ like the Google.com homepage.

~~Optional: Build a webpage that mimics the Google.com [search results page](https://www.google.com/search?q=build+this+webpage).~~ 

    - I ended up choosing not to do the search page. I want to keep moving forward and building up other foundational skills. 

In order to achieve the aforementioned goals, I intend to work on the Odin Project for one hour a day until completion.

## Reflection
My goal was to create a web page that looks like the Google Homepage. In order to do that, based off of my github commit log: I started by creating an introduction to the HTML/CSS project, which is why I'm writing this reflection now because otherwise I'd forget. Then, I created the empty files and directories for the google home page project and used a CSS reset, so that I could ensure I was building from scratch (as much as I could) and therefore reducing the chances that the browser default settings would interfere. Based off what I learned, I recognized that it's important to start with the content/structure and then build up to the styling, so I made the empty HTML elements first and added the google icon, text for the buttons, etc. At some point, I thought that it was way too intuitive to center things using the old way of styling, using margin auto and thought: "Hmm, there's already a better way for doing this and I'm starting out without the baggage of having learned the old way, so why not do it the better and more intuitive way?" That thought let me to learn Flexbox, which brought me into the world of games for learning CSS, which made learning more fun. I got to fight zombies, do tower defense in another game, play with froggies, do some minecraft coding at Hour of Code, etc. These were fun diversions, but they also taught me a very useful way to style the page and made it so much easier to center the content and also make the page adapt more easily to changes in the viewport height and width. 

After I completed my version of the project, I showed it to my friend Nav and he suggested that I do one last thing... which was to center the search buttons and I did. I had been procrastinating on that because it seemed difficult, but it turned out to be as simple as creating another div and letting flexbox take care of it! The end product looks a lot more like Google's Homepage than I thought I could have made, so this was an affirming experience that with time, effort, and experimentation and learning from my mistakes, that I could improve my web development skills. 

Now, I'm excited to continue on with my learning and I'm building the confidence that with time, consistent effort, and incremental improvement, I'll be able to become a valuable software developer!
