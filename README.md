This repository contains the HTML/CSS project for The Odin Project's [Web Development 101 Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css?ref=lnav).

I am starting this project on 12/7/2019 and anticipate that the following skills, copy and pasted from the Odin Project:

```
Two ways to move a div around on the page
Stick a div onto the bottom or top of the page
Identify the background color of an existing webpage
Grab the URL for an image from an existing webpage
Center an element horizontally
Identify three ways you can include your CSS styles in a page
Understand how to use classes and ids to target CSS at specific elements on the page
Build a very basic form (even if it doesn’t “go” anywhere)
```

## Goals:

- [ ] Upon completion of the project, I intend to review what I've done in this project and what I've learned. 

  - [ ] What have I done in this project?
  - [ ] What have I learned?

- [ ] Build a webpage that _looks_ like the Google.com homepage.
- [ ] Optional: Build a webpage that mimics the Google.com [search results page](https://www.google.com/search?q=build+this+webpage).

In order to achieve the aforementioned goals, I intend to work on the Odin Project for one hour a day until completion.
